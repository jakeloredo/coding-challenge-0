The solution is written in the form of a Python script.
Python 3.5 or higher is required.
The script will read the input data from a file named inputdata.txt located in the same directory.
The script can be run with no arguments:

> python solution.py

The tests are written using the unittest library. Test cases are in the solution_tests.py script:

> python -m unittest solution_tests.py
